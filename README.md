# Mark Knopfler's personal website

There are many websites out there, but this one is mine. 

The underlying tech of this website uses the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). All styles are handled by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and a minimal amount of JavaScript is utilized throughout. 

## Installation
```shell
npm install
```
The Hugo binary is managed by `hugo-bin`, so there you don't have to worry about having it installed globally.

## Running in development mode
```shell
npm start
```

## Building the app for production
```shell
npm run build
```
